# Pizza_Shop_Sales_Data_Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Creation by Using PowerBI)
## Project Objective
  The objective of this project is to develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales performance. By tracking key KPIs such as total revenue, orders, and average order value, the dashboard helps identify top-performing pizzas, categories, and sizes while uncovering customer demand patterns across days, weeks, and months. It also highlights weekday vs weekend performance and peak sales hours, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions to optimize menu offerings, marketing strategies, and operational efficiency.
